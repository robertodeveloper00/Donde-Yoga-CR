I was looking to put State Management, Fetch() and the Google Maps API in practice, but I didn't just want to copy a project.
Rather I wanted to create something more personal with the potential to be used by real people and therefore the idea for this app was born.

The branding and aesthetics of the app were pretty spontaneous.

It was all done with HMTL, CSS and Vainilla JavaScript.

## The approach

### Step One

* I gathered the information by foot and created a local JSON file to simulate my API.

### Step Two

* I then dynamically displayed the information on the screen and added the accordion functionality

### Step Three

* I struggled around to figure out the Google Maps API and didn't give up until the functionality was just I imagined it.

### Step Four

* I hosted it on GitHub, no build process or anything.
